<p>The Correlation Indicator is a valuable tool in technical analysis, designed to quantify the degree of relationship between the price movements of a target security (e.g., a stock or ETF) and a reference market index. It measures how closely the target’s price changes are aligned with the fluctuations of the index over a specific period of time, providing insights into the target’s susceptibility to market movements. A positive correlation indicates that the target tends to move in the same direction as the market index, while a negative correlation suggests an inverse relationship. A correlation close to 0 implies a weak or no linear relationship. Commonly, the SPX index is employed as the benchmark for the overall market when calculating correlation, ensuring a consistent and reliable reference point. This helps traders and investors make informed decisions regarding the risk and behavior of the target security in relation to market trends. The indicator only updates when both assets have a price for a time step. When a bar is missing for one of the assets, the indicator value fills forward to improve the accuracy of the indicator.</p>
