<p>The Klinger Volume Oscillator (KVO) is a technical indicator that analyzes the relationship between price movement and trading volume to assess the strength of market trends and identify potential trend reversals. As a volume-based oscillator, it measures the force behind price movements by incorporating volume data adjusted for price trends and specific conditions. Traders use the KVO to analyze its behavior relative to price action, looking for patterns such as divergences or crossovers that can provide insights into market trends and potential turning points.</p>
